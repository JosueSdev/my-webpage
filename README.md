## About duplication

Most references to image files are missing from this repo as I don't have ownership over them, yet the app should build just fine without them. All references to images are stored in json files under the [/resources](https://github.com/JosueSdev/my-webpage/tree/master/resources) directory.

## Characteristics

* Static generation: efficient and SEO friendly.
* Markdown file rendering.
* Metadata: native html and OpenGraph.
* i18n internationalization.
* Theme selector.
